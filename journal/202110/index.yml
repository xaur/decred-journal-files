  title: Remote Node Outpost
  author: saender
  notes: Had Iceland in mind, land of the ice and volcanos but somewhat more remote and extraterrestrial (contrast between artificial and organic), also rifts under the snow indicating subtle hazardous activity. Parallel to Kubrick's monolith w/ skull bashing monkeys in Space Odyssey 2001 but in a cold climate. A Kubrick's node.
