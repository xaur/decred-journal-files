  title: Point Integral
  author: saender
  notes: In a direct visual sense it is a play of contrast, not so much with color but geometry, automatically forces oneself comparing one focal point to entropy of verticals. In a metaphorical sense it is a comparison between all the little things that dissipate attention opposed to clear direction. In short every project should have "point integral". Decred has it.
